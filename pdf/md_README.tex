An efficient finite impulse response (FIR) filter class in C++, JAVA wrapper for Android and Python wrapper.

The floating point class offers also adaptive filtering using the least mean square (LMS) or normalised least mean square (NLMS) algorithm.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

These functions are the same in C++, JAVA and Python\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily get\+Taps()} returns the length of the FIR filter kernel.
\item {\ttfamily reset()} sets all delay lines to zero.
\item {\ttfamily zero\+Coeff()} sets all coefficients to zero.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Retreiving the coefficients/kernel from the FIR filter is different depending on the language used\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md25}{}\doxyparagraph{C++}\label{md_README_autotoc_md25}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily void get\+Coeff(double$\ast$ target, unsigned length) const} copies the FIR kernel into the given C array of {\ttfamily double}s with length {\ttfamily length}.

If {\ttfamily length} exceeds the length of the filter kernel, the result is zero-\/padded to fill the given array.

If {\ttfamily length} is smaller than the filter kernel, a {\ttfamily std\+::out\+\_\+of\+\_\+range} exception is thrown.
\item {\ttfamily std\+::vector\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}double\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} get\+Coeff\+Vector() const} returns a copy of the filter kernel.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md26}{}\doxyparagraph{Python}\label{md_README_autotoc_md26}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily get\+Coeff(n \+: int) -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} numpy.\+array} as per the C++ method, following the zero-\/padding and exception-\/throwing behaviour of the C++. The returned array will have {\ttfamily n} elements.
\item {\ttfamily get\+Coeff() -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} numpy.\+array} additional to the C++ methods, this returns an numpy array which is a copy of the filter kernel. This is probably the default use case in Python.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md27}{}\doxyparagraph{JAVA}\label{md_README_autotoc_md27}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily double\mbox{[}\mbox{]} get\+Coeff()} returns a double array of the filter kernel.
\item {\ttfamily double\mbox{[}\mbox{]} get\+Coeff(n \+: int)} as per the C++ method, following the zero-\/padding and exception-\/throwing behaviour of the C++. The returned array will have {\ttfamily n} elements.

The least mean square algorithm adjusts the FIR coefficients h\+\_\+m with the help of an error signal e(n)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{h\_m(n+1) = h\_m(n) + learning\_rate * h\_m(n) * e(n)}

\end{DoxyCode}
 using the function {\ttfamily lms\+\_\+update(e)} while performing the filtering with {\ttfamily filter()}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysubsubsection{How to use the filter}\label{md_README_autotoc_md32}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Construct the Fir filter with all coefficients set to zero\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classFir1}{Fir1(n\+Coeff)}}}
\item Set the learning\+\_\+rate with the method {\ttfamily set\+Learning\+Rate(learning\+\_\+rate)}.
\item Provide the input signal {\ttfamily x} to the FIR filter and use its standard {\ttfamily filter} method to filter it.
\item Define your error which needs to be minimised\+: {\ttfamily e = d -\/ y}
\item Feed the error back into the filter with the method {\ttfamily lms\+\_\+update(e)}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\ttfamily lmsdemo} in the demo directory makes this concept much clearer how to remove artefacts with this method.



The above plot shows the filter in action which removes 50Hz noise with the adaptive filter. Learning is very fast and the learning rate here is deliberately kept low to show how it works.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsubsection{Stability}\label{md_README_autotoc_md33}
The FIR filter itself is stable but the error signal changes the filter coefficients which in turn change the error and so on. There is a rule of thumb that the learning rate should be less than the \char`\"{}tap power\char`\"{} of the input signal which is just the sum of all squared values held in the different taps\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{learning\_rate < 1/getTapInputPower()}

\end{DoxyCode}
 That allows an adaptive learning rate which is called \char`\"{}normalised LMS\char`\"{}. From my experiments that works in theory but in practise the realtime value of get\+Tap\+Input\+Power() can make the algorithm easily unstable because it might suggest infinite learning rates and can fluctuate wildly. A better approach is to keep the learning rate constant and rather control the power of the input signal by, for example, normalising the input signal or limiting it.

See the demo below which removes 50Hz from an ECG which uses a normalised 50Hz signal which guarantees stability by design.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsubsection{JAVA/\+Python}\label{md_README_autotoc_md34}
The commands under JAVA and Python are identical to C++.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{Demos}\label{md_README_autotoc_md35}
Demo programs are in the \char`\"{}demo\char`\"{} directory which show how to use the filters for both floating point and fixed point.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily firdemo} sends an impulse into the filter and you should see the impulse response at its output.
\item {\ttfamily fixeddemo} filters an example ECG with 50Hz noise. The coefficients are 12 bit and you can generate them either with OCTAVE/\+MATLAB or Python. The scripts are also provided.
\item {\ttfamily lmsdemo} filters out 50Hz noise from an ECG with the help of adaptive filtering by using the 50Hz powerline frequency as the input to the filter. This can be replaced by any reference artefact signal or signal which is correlated with the artefact.
\item JAVA has an {\ttfamily Instrumented\+Test} which filters both a delta pulse and a step function.
\item filter\+\_\+ecg.\+py performs the filtering of an ECG in python using the fir1 python module which in turn calls internally the C++ functions.
