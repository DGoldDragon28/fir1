The {\ttfamily signal-\/cleaner} tool may be used to run the lms fir algorithm on a noisey input file and produce a clean output file. The noise source is also required. All inputs are files with {\ttfamily .wav} extenstion.\hypertarget{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md67}{}\doxysubsection{Build}\label{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md67}
To try out {\ttfamily signal-\/cleaner}, you can build the program with {\ttfamily cmake} from the root level {\ttfamily fir/} directory or from this directory as shown\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md68}{}\doxysubsection{Usage}\label{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md68}
A usage example is provided below\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Usage: ./signal-\/cleaner[-\/l <lrate>] [-\/n <ntaps>] [-\/o <file>] <noise-\/source> [<input>]}

\end{DoxyCode}


As well as providing input and noise sources, the {\ttfamily ntaps} and {\ttfamily lrate} for the filter may be configured.

If no output file is specified, the program will output to {\ttfamily stdout}.

If no input file is specified, the program will input from {\ttfamily stdin}.\hypertarget{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md69}{}\doxysubsection{Output}\label{md_SignalCleaner_README_autotoc_md69}
The output file is the filtered result.
