This is a library which implements an efficient FIR filter

How to use it
-------------
You can set the coefficients either with a C floating point array or
with a text file containing the coefficients. This text file with the
coefficients can easily be generated by MATLAB or OCTAVE with their
filter toolboxes, for example:
octave:1> h=fir1(100,0.1);
octave:2> save 'h.dat' h -ascii
which creates the coefficients of a lowpass filter with 100 taps
and normalised cutoff 0.1 (in MATLAB convention).
Then, in the C program you just write:
Fir1 fir("h.dat");
to create the FIR lowpass which then can be fed with continuous data:
float b = fir.filter(a);

Installation
------------
This is done with the standard sequence:
sh autogen.sh
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

A demo program is in the "demo" directory which demonstrates the
reaction of the filter to an impulse response. A delta pulse is sent
into the filter and saved as a gnuplot/octave file. This should look
identical to the coefficients as the coefficients ARE the impulse
response.

This library has been adapted form Graeme Hattan's original C code.

Enjoy!
