This is a library which implements an efficient FIR filter.

You can set the coefficients either with a C floating point array or
with a text file containing the coefficients. This text file with the
coefficients can easily be generated by MATLAB or OCTAVE with their
filter toolboxes.

Installation is done with the standard sequence:
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

A demo program is in the "demo" directory which demonstrates the
reaction of the filter to an impulse response.  A delta pulse is sent
into the filter and saved as a gnuplot/octave file. This should look
identical to the coefficients.

This library has been adapted form Graeme Hattan's original code.

Enjoy!
