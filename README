This is a library which implements an efficient FIR filter.

You can set the coefficients either with a floating point
array or with a text file containing the coefficients.

Installation is done with the standard sequence:
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

A demo program is in the "demo" directory which demonstrates
an impulse response. A delta pulse is sent into the filter
and saved as a gnuplot/octave file. This should look identical
to the coefficients.

This library has been adapted form Graeme Hattan's original code.

Enjoy!
