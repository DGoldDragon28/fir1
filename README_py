====
Fir1
====

An efficient finite impulse response (FIR) filter class
written in C++ with python wrapper.

The class offers also adaptive filtering
using the least mean square (LMS) or normalised least mean
square (NLMS) algorithm.

Installation
============

The preferred way to install is with pip::

    pip3 install fir1

You can also install from source with ``python3 setup.py install``.

    git clone https://github.com/berndporr/fir1
    cd fir1
    python3 setup.py install


Usage
=====

Realtime filtering
------------------

The filter is a realtime filter which always receives the
values one by one so can process data as it comes in from
an ADC converter. This is simulated here with the for loop::

    import fir1
    b = signal.firwin(999,0.1)
    f = fir1.Fir1(b)
    for i in range(len(noisy_signal)):
        clean_signal[i] = f.filter(noisy_signal[i])

The constructor ``Fir1(b)`` receives the coefficients and
then filtering is performed with the method ``filter()``.


LMS adaptive filter
-------------------

Please check the C++ code for examples and the main
github page. The functions are identical.
